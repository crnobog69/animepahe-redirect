## What it does

- **Automatic redirect**: If you visit `animepahe.ru`, instantly redirects to `animepahe.si`
- **Link replacement**: Finds and updates all `animepahe.ru` links on any webpage
- **Click interception**: Handles clicks on old links and redirects them

## Features

- Works on **all websites** (`*://*/*`)
- Silent operation (no visual indicators)
- Console logging for debugging
- Handles both direct navigation and link clicks

## Why?

The `animepahe.ru` domain no longer exists, but many websites and applications still reference it. This script ensures you'll always reach the correct working domain (`animepahe.si`) without encountering "This site can't be reached" errors.
